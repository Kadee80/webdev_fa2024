# HW Week06: Continue Working on Midterm Sites

This week we will be going through advance hover effects, modals (pop up windows) and based on class input, maybe another popular topic. _Next week_ we will also be going over image sizing and optimization for web. If there is enough interest, we can go over some other simple/common Photoshop moves. Be sure to speak up and make suggestions in class or via email! Please make sure you have Adobe Photoshop installed by Week07.

Hopefully, by now you have your layouts started in HTML and CSS. Keep working on your sites. Your Midterm Project Presentations will be on **TUESDAY OCT 22**.

Be sure to include at least one media query in your CSS for responsive behavior. Ideally, you have some layout/style changes on both tablet and mobile. I will be asking you to resize you screen when you demo! Don't forget, you can hide/show things on resize, sometimes a completely different set of HTML and CSS is neccessary depending on what you are displaying.

Since we cannot cover every possible example needed before your midterm is due here are a few links to some W3Schools tutorials you might find helpful. If you use these tutorials in your project, be prepared to discuss how the code works, especially if it incorporates some javascript!
