# Homework Week05: Begin working on your midterm project.

Due to last Thursday's class's last minute interruption, your midterm project proposals will be presented THURSDAY this week instead of Tuesday. We will be looking at flexbox properties and Media Queries (responsive styling) on Tuesday.

Please keep in mind that your midterm will need to include AT LEASE ONE MEDIA QUERY. Please make sure your wireframes include a design for both Desktop and Mobile. Please design based on what you'd like to ideally achieve, not based on what you know how to do at this moment.

In class exercises from now until Midterm will try to cover as many "I need to learn" topics from your presentations so please make sure you present your wish list of topics!

I highly suggest you tackle page layouts first, aka rows and columns etc before worrying about content and images.
