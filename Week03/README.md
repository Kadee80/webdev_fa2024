# HW - Due Tuesday, Week 4

By now we should have gotten the hang of some simple git and GitHub terminal commands. By Tuesday of next week, be sure to have posted folders with all HW assignments to this point to your HW repository. For example, HW assigned Week01 should be posted to a Week01/ folder in your repo.

**I will be doing a thorough review of all of your repos, any missing assignments will be marked as a 0.** _Make sure you have the current correct information filled out on the class repo spreadsheet by then as well. If I can't find it, I can't mark it as completed._

This week we will build upon our recipe website/page. Using the entry level CSS we covered this week, begin adding styles to your recipe page. (you should have a pure html markup already from last weeks assignment!) Play around with fonts, colors, margins, padding, and maybe some inline-block, and any other CSS properties we have covered so far. Don't worry if it isnt perfect. Flexbox awaits next week, but any effort attempting to style with rows, columns, and grids will only help your grade!

If you are still unfamiliar with git, practice! [Here is a helpful tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) that explains what git does and how to use it with github.
