# HOMEWORK: DUE TUES, WEEK02:

- [Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

- Add your github repo link to the [class roster google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mptgxdD0XdaCIBRf2HWL-ANWwcwrEdOCwUVvQSTkMgA/edit?usp=sharing).
  Make sure you add your name/email/repo to the correct sheet/section. You can view different sheets via the labeled tabs on the bottom.

- Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We wonâ€™t be using Photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

- Take a look at this [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You will be using markdown files to document your work in this class.

- Make a new folder in _your_ class repo called Week01. This is where you will be adding/submitting this weeks HW assignments.

- Create a `recipe.md` file and format your recipe with different text sizes and styles as well as bulleted and numbered lists. _Think Hierarchy_ your recipe layout in markdown should resemble a microsoft word document.

- Create an `index.html` file containing a recipe card. The recipe card should contain:

  - A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
  - Brief description of the recipe
  - List of ingredients
  - List of instructions
  - DO NOT WORRY ABOUT CSS STYLING THIS WEEK!

- Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class this week.
