# Local Storage

The local storage object allows us to save key value pairs (like an object) in the browser itself. This data is NOT deleted once the browser window is closed, so it is available when a user returns again.

Honestly, this is a short topic/demo and all of the methods we will take a look at can be found in the [W3 Schools Local Storage Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp).
